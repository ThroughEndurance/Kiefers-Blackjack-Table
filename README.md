## Beginner Tips

1. Card values are the number displayed on the card ex) 2 of spades = "2"
2. All face cards ex) King, have a value of "10".
3. Ace cards have a value of "11" or "1". Whichever the player chooses!
4. To help out new players, the game calculates and displays your total and the dealers total for you. No counting necessary!
