## Getting Started

1. Load the game https://throughendurance.github.io/Kiefers-Blackjack-Table/
2. Click the "Deal" button to start the game. This will deal two cards to the player and dealer.
3. Player can then click the "hit" button to get another card, or "stay" to pass the turn over to the dealer.
4. After the stay button is clicked the dealer draws cards until they are over 16.
5. Once dealer's turn is done, win condition logic is applied and the game result is displayed at the bottom.
6. Remember: The goal is to have a higher total than the dealer, WITHOUT going over 21. If the dealer goes over 21, you win!

## Beginner Tips

1. Card values are the number displayed on the card ex) 2 of spades = "2"
2. All face cards ex) King, have a value of "10".
3. Ace cards have a value of "11" or "1". Whichever the player chooses! In this game the best possible decision is made automatically. 
4. To help out new players, the game calculates and displays your total and the dealers total for you. No counting necessary!
